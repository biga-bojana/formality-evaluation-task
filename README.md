# Formality Evaluation

This project evaluates different approaches to detecting **formality in text**, comparing fine-tuned models, zero-shot classification, rule-based heuristics, and large language models (LLMs) as evaluators.

The task was part of a machine learning internship assignment to design an evaluation system for formality detection models. It covers dataset construction, model selection, evaluation metrics, and analysis of results.
